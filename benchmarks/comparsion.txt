All lock-free queues are really close, they differ only in some details.

my queue -
    enqueue is even wait-free, so really fast and non blocking adding of elements

mutex queue -
    really slow for more threads, but really, really fast to implement (so start with this
    one and implement better only if its a performance bottleneck.
