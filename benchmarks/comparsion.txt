All lock-free queues are really close, they differ only in some details.

my queue -
    enqueue is even wait-free, so really fast and non blocking adding of elements

epoch queue -
    there is some not-trivial work with epochs, so it's a bit slower for few threads

ms queue -
    although just rewritten from pseudo-code, there is some error and last benchmark
    doesn't work. But who knows what can be wrong, when there's nothing written in the
    paper about how does it work.

mutex queue -
    really slow for more threads, but really, really fast to implement (so start with this
    one and implement better only if its a performance bottleneck.
